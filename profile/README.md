DynaPlex is a software library for solving Markov Decision Problems and similar models (POMDP, HMM) written primarily in C++20 with bindings for python. It supports deep reinforcement learning, approximate dynamic programming, classical parameterized policies, and exact methods based on policy and value iteration. Models in DynaPlex are written in C++, and exposed via a generic and vectorized interface.

DynaPlex focuses on solving problems arising in Operations Management: Supply Chain, Transportation and Logistics, Manufacturing, etc.
